This project is designed to solve the local energy bottleneck in AFQMC by a machine learning model to map from one body reduced density matrices to local energies. The models tested include KRR, GPR, XGBoost, Elasticnet, and SVRwhich are compare to a mean baseline. The data is generated by building the wavefunction for a 16 atom hydrogen chain in the ipie AFQMC package. This was perfomred in python 3.12.5 using ipie 0.7.1, and scikit-learn 1.5.1. More package details can be found in the yaml file.
Data Generated with the following code
